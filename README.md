# LSTM-Random-Forest-XGBoost-Stock-Predictor-with-Optuna
A hybrid AI-based stock market prediction system using LSTM, Random Forest, and XGBoost, built for real-world deployment with Optuna-powered tuning, feature-rich engineering, and ensemble prediction logic. Designed to optimize F1 score and accuracy, this system aims to generate reliable buy/sell signals on stocks.
# 📈 LSTM + Random Forest + XGBoost Stock Predictor

## 🚀 About the Project
This project integrates:
- 🔁 **Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM)** for sequential financial patterns
- 🌲 **Random Forest** for ensemble-based classification
- ⚡ **XGBoost** for gradient boosting decision trees
- 🎯 **Optuna** for automatic hyperparameter tuning (optional mode)
- 📊 **Backtesting Module** to simulate trading performance

> ⚙️ Built by a Computer Engineering student to demonstrate real-world ML/AI skills in finance and time series prediction.

## 📌 Features

- ✔️ Ensemble of 3 models: LSTM + RF + XGBoost
- ✔️ Flag-based retraining (no need to retrain every time)
- ✔️ Real stock data from Yahoo Finance
- ✔️ Feature-rich engineering: RSI, Moving Averages, Volatility, Volume
- ✔️ Backtesting for historical performance validation
- ✔️ Soft voting for final trade signal (BUY / SELL)
- ✔️ CLI-based output, no GUI bloat
- ✔️ Saved model reuse (`models/` folder)

## 🧪 How to Run

### ✅ 1. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
If no requirements.txt, install manually
pip install yfinance numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost tensorflow optuna

---

### ✅ 2. Run Prediction Scripts
#### Without Optuna (default hyperparameters):
python "LSTM+Random Forest+XGboost Stock Predictor.py"

#### With Optuna (automatic tuning):
python "LSTM+Random Forest+XGboost Stock Predictor with optuna.py"

---

### ✅ 3. Backtest the System
python backtest.py
This will simulate trades and give statistics based on past 3 years of stock data.
